requestHeader:
     { Accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
       'User-Agent': 'axios/0.19.2' } } }

Explain: 

Accept: <MIME_type>/<MIME_subtype>
Accept: <MIME_type>/*
Accept: */*

<MIME_type>/<MIME_subtype>
A single, precise MIME type, like text/html.
<MIME_type>/*
A MIME type, but without any subtype. image/* will match image/png, image/svg, image/gif and any other image types.
*/*
Any MIME type


The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.

User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>
->
   <product>
   A product identifier — its name or development codename.
   <product-version>
   Version number of the product.

Respose headers:
     { expires: 'Sun, 02 Feb 2020 05:23:00 GMT',
       date: 'Sun, 02 Feb 2020 05:23:00 GMT',
       'cache-control': 'private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform',
       etag: '"iPPser6Mov75mJUb_EktR4oB1SI/g1fOZyoV7e2tUbD9dsDGb1Qk-N4"',

Explain:
-> 
expires:  The Expires header contains the date/time after which the response is considered stale
date: The Date general HTTP header contains the date and time at which the message was originated
cache-control: Cache-control is an HTTP header used to specify browser caching policies in both client requests and server responses. Policies include how a resource is cached, where it's cached and its maximum age before expiring
etag:  It lets caches be more efficient and save bandwidth, as a web server does not need to resend a full response if the content has not changed. Additionally, etags help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other
vary:   determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server
content-type:  Content-Type header tells the client what the content type of the returned content actually is
x-content-type-options:
x-frame-options: indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> , <iframe> , <embed> or <object>
x-xss-protection:  stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
Server: contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request
Connection:  controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes
